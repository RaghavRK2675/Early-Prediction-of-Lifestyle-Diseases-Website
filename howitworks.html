                <div class="main-content-heading">The Early Prediction of Lifestyle Diseases model leverages Machine Learning (ML) techniques to analyze user health data and predict the risk of lifestyle diseases such as diabetes or hypertension.<br>Here’s how it works step by step:</div>
                <div class="main-content-description">
                    &#11208;Data Collection – Users provide health details like BMI, activity level, diet, smoking, alcohol, BP, cholesterol, etc.<br>
                    &#11208;Preprocessing – Data is cleaned, normalized, and encoded for ML processing.<br>
                    &#11208;Model Training – A classification/regression model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM) is trained using historical health data.<br>
                    &#11208;Prediction & Risk Analysis – The model predicts disease risk (Low, Medium, High) based on user inputs.<br>
                    &#11208;Preventive Recommendations – Personalized suggestions (e.g., diet, exercise, monitoring) help reduce disease risk.<br>
                    &#11208;Continuous Learning – The model improves over time with new user data and wearable device integration.
