                <div class="main-content-description">
                    Data Collection – Users provide health details like BMI, activity level, diet, smoking, alcohol, BP, cholesterol, etc.<br>
Preprocessing – Data is cleaned, normalized, and encoded for ML processing.<br>
Model Training – A classification/regression model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM) is trained using historical health data.<br>
Prediction & Risk Analysis – The model predicts disease risk (Low, Medium, High) based on user inputs.<br>
Preventive Recommendations – Personalized suggestions (e.g., diet, exercise, monitoring) help reduce disease risk.<br>
Continuous Learning – The model improves over time with new user data and wearable device integration.
